# Memory Atlas — TODO Notes  

This file tracks ideas and improvements that are intentionally **out of scope for v1** .
---
## AI-first design

Memory Atlas is designed to be AI-first in two ways:

1) **Discoverability:** v1 is serving story content dynamically generated by js and stored in the /src folder. A later version needs a python script to compile content into plain html and store it in the /dist folder. Then change GitHub Pages serve folder. This will allow search engines and chatbots to  reliably read the site (not all crawlers execute JavaScript). In future versions we'll also publish `sitemap.xml` (for crawl discovery) and  `llms.txt` (an emerging convention for LLM-oriented site entry points).

2) **Development & future features:** AI is part of the development workflow today, and later versions may add AI-assisted authoring (image/text generation and editing) and learning workflows (e.g., spaced repetition / memory-palace style interactions).

## SPA
v1 is a multi-page application (MPA). Investigate adding a router and converting parts of the application to SPA for better responsivness

## Open Standards & Interoperability 

Investigate adding support for open standards.

### Microformats (IndieWeb)

* Explore adding Microformats2 classes to rendered HTML

  * `h-feed` for landing page
  * `h-entry` for story pages
  * `p-name`, `p-summary`, `dt-published`, `u-photo`
* Ensure additions are progressive-enhancement only (no JS dependency)
* Goal: machine-readable personal publishing, no backend required

### Schema.org / JSON-LD

* Consider adding JSON-LD for public stories

  * `Article` / `BlogPosting`
  * `ImageGallery` / `Photograph`
* Evaluate SEO value vs added complexity

## Authoring & Editing

* Explore Markdown + front‑matter as an alternative authoring format
* Possible future UI editor that writes JSON

---

## Navigation & UX Enhancements

* Keyboard navigation for cards
* Accessibility review (focus states, ARIA for modals)
* Motion/animation preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
